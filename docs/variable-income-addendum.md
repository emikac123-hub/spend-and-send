# Variable Income Addendum

This addendum describes how the Spend & Send Method adapts for people with variable, irregular, or unpredictable income (freelancers, contractors, commission-based work, gig income, seasonal work).

The core philosophy does not change.

What changes is when money is considered safe to spend.

**This document is optional and intended as guidance, not requirement.**

## Core Mindset Shift

**For fixed income:**
"I will get paid on a predictable date."

**For variable income:**
"Money is not real until it has cleared and proven itself."

- Spend & Send treats cash-on-hand as truth.
- Forecasts, averages, and expectations are not spendable.

## What Does Not Change

The following pillars remain intact:

- Four Walls First
- Discretionary Pool
- Per Diem pacing
- Debt reduction as a priority
- Awareness over restriction

Variable income does not invalidate the method — it simply requires more patience.

## The Safety Buffer Rule

For variable income users, Spend & Send strongly recommends establishing a minimum safety buffer before discretionary spending expands.

**Recommended default:**
One full Four Walls cycle (e.g., one month of fixed obligations)

**Note:** This is a goal, not a starting requirement. Building a buffer takes time. Start with what you can, and grow it gradually.

**Until this buffer exists:**

- Discretionary spending is cautious
- Per diem may be low or paused
- Windfalls are treated conservatively

This buffer is not excess — it is stability.

## Income Handling (Practical Flow)

- All incoming money lands in the Main / Stability Account
- No immediate lifestyle increase occurs
- Fixed obligations are protected first
- Only money beyond the safety buffer becomes discretionary
- Spend & Send never assumes future income.

## Tax Considerations

For freelancers, contractors, and self-employed individuals, tax obligations require special attention.

**Tax reserves are not optional — they are a fixed obligation.**

**Recommended approach:**

- Set aside a percentage of every payment received (typically 25-30% for federal taxes, plus state/local if applicable)
- Treat tax reserves as part of the Four Walls — they are not discretionary
- Keep tax reserves in a separate account or clearly marked portion of the Stability Account
- Make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid penalties and year-end surprises

**Self-employment tax** (Social Security and Medicare) applies to net earnings and is often overlooked. Factor this into your reserve percentage.

Tax reserves should be established before expanding discretionary spending, even if it means a smaller per diem initially.

## Irregular Expenses

Variable income earners must also account for irregular but predictable expenses:

- Annual insurance premiums
- Professional fees or licenses
- Equipment maintenance or replacement
- Quarterly or annual subscriptions
- Business expenses (if applicable)

**How to handle:**

- Identify these expenses and their timing
- Build them into the safety buffer calculation
- Or create a separate sinking fund within the Stability Account
- Treat them as fixed obligations, not surprises

The goal is to prevent these expenses from disrupting the Four Walls during lean periods.

## Per Diem for Variable Income

Per diem still applies — but it is adaptive.

**Instead of:**
"$40/day for the next two weeks"

**The rule becomes:**
"This is your safe daily pace until new income arrives."

**Key behaviors:**

- Per diem may decrease during slow periods
- Per diem increases cautiously after deposits
- Unused per diem still rolls forward
- Overspending still borrows from future days

**This prevents:**

- Overspending after a single good check
- Panic during a dry spell

## Windfalls and Large Deposits

Large or unexpected income should be treated in this order:

1. Replenish or strengthen the safety buffer
2. Pay down existing debt
3. Gradually increase discretionary per diem

Sudden income should not immediately redefine lifestyle.

Variable income rewards patience more than optimism.

## Credit Cards and Variable Income

Credit cards carry additional risk for variable earners.

**Spend & Send assumes:**

- Spending is logged when it happens
- Payment method does not delay awareness
- Carrying balances increases fragility

**Credit card use should never:**

- Replace missing income
- Bypass per diem limits
- Delay financial reality

Variable income makes credit card debt especially dangerous because repayment ability is uncertain. If you must use credit, ensure you have the cash available to pay it off immediately.

## The Feast and Famine Cycle

Variable income often follows patterns: busy seasons and slow seasons, feast and famine.

**Common pitfalls:**

- Spending like the good times will last forever
- Panicking during slow periods
- Using credit to maintain lifestyle during lean times

**Spend & Send approach:**

- Good months build stability, not lifestyle inflation
- Slow months are expected and planned for
- The safety buffer smooths out the cycle
- Per diem adapts to current reality, not past performance

The psychological challenge is real. The system provides structure when willpower is low.

## Why This Works

Variable income fails most budgets because:

- Spending rises faster than stability
- Good months mask bad ones
- Stress arrives suddenly

**This adaptation prioritizes:**

- Solvency over comfort
- Calm over optimization
- Survival over averages

## Closing Thought

Variable income requires a system that:

- Accepts uncertainty
- Moves slowly on good news
- Protects against quiet risk

Spend & Send does not ask variable earners to predict the future.

It asks them to respect the present.

Progress may be slower — but it is far more durable.
