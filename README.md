# The Spend & Send Method (v1)

## Purpose

Spend & Send exists to reduce financial stress by replacing complex budgeting with simple, repeatable rules that work in real life.

This method is built on lived experience — a system used by a real family to pay off significant debt without spreadsheets, guilt, or constant monitoring.

## Core Beliefs

- **Money anxiety comes from uncertainty, not spending.** When people know their essentials are covered and their daily pace is safe, spending becomes calm and intentional.

- **Safety comes before freedom.** Financial peace begins when the Four Walls are secured first, every pay period.

- **Daily clarity beats monthly precision.** People don't spend in months. They spend in moments. A daily framework prevents regret better than end-of-month reports.

- **Consistency matters more than perfection.** A system people can follow imperfectly is better than one they abandon entirely.

- **Trust is earned through simplicity.** Fewer assumptions. Fewer automations. Clear math. Human confirmation.

## The Three Rules of Spend & Send

### Rule 1: Secure the Four Walls First

On payday, all required expenses are handled immediately:

- Housing
- Utilities
- Food (groceries)
- Transportation

Once these are funded, they are considered safe for the pay period. No daily decision should threaten them.

### Rule 2: Define the Discretionary Pool

After the Four Walls are secured, all remaining money becomes discretionary. This pool represents freedom — not recklessness.

Discretionary money is allowed to be spent without guilt, as long as it is paced correctly.

### Rule 3: Live by the Per Diem

The discretionary pool is divided by the number of days until the next payday. This creates a per diem:

- The maximum safe amount that can be spent per day without hitting zero.
- If a user never exceeds their per diem over time, they will never run out of money.
- Unused per diem rolls forward.
- Overspending gently borrows from future days.

The goal is awareness, not restriction.

## How Spend & Send Behaves

- Spend & Send never shames spending.
- Spend & Send never blocks purchases.
- Spend & Send explains context, not judgment.
- Spend & Send prefers defaults over endless options.
- Spend & Send asks before assuming.
- Spend & Send keeps the human in the loop.

The system supports decisions — it does not replace them.

## What Success Looks Like

**Success is not:**

- Perfect adherence
- Zero discretionary spending
- Aggressive restriction

**Success is:**

- Fewer financial surprises
- Fewer "how did this happen?" moments
- Confidence that today's spending won't cause tomorrow's stress
- Steady progress without burnout

## Guiding Principle

If your Four Walls are secure and your per diem is respected, you are financially safe — even if life isn't perfect.

Spend & Send exists to make that safety visible, daily.
