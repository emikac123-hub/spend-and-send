# Savings and Investing (How It Was Lived)

In this implementation of the Spend & Send Method, savings and investing were treated as extensions of safety, not discretionary goals.

## The Sequence

The sequence followed was:

1. Build a starter emergency fund ($1,000)
2. Eliminate consumer debt
3. Expand the emergency fund to approximately three months of expenses
4. Increase retirement investing (approximately 15% of income)

## How Savings Were Handled

- Savings contributions were directed to a separate savings account and treated as part of the Four Walls
- Once allocated, this money was considered unavailable for discretionary spending
- This approach reduced decision fatigue and prevented savings from becoming a source of temptation or backsliding

## How Investing Was Handled

- Retirement investing was automated and prioritized once stability was established
- Investing was treated as a fixed obligation, not an optional goal
